# Javascript Objects

The goal of these scripts is to test some of the characteristics of Javascript's Objects.

In order to execute these scripts, install Node and run:

    > node nameofthescript.js


## Different ways of creating an object

* In [script_01.js](script.js)...
  * I create an **object literal** 
  * I create an **Object Constructor** and create an object from this Constructor

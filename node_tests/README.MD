# Javascript Objects

The goal of these scripts is to test some of the characteristics of Javascript's Objects.

You may execute the scripts using __Node__ if you don't want to use a browser:

    > node nameofthescript.js


## Different ways of creating an object

* In [script_01.js](script_01.js) I show that an String is an Object that uses a Prototype. No mather how you create an string in Javascript, it is always an String object, or rather, [the _prototype_ of every string it's the String prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype)
* In [script_0x.js](script.js)...
  * I create an **object literal** 
  * I create an **Object Constructor** and create an object from this Constructor

## Visual Studio Code

- [ ] Use `extensions` but don't overuse them!
- [ ] Use a `workspace` to use specifically for every subject (every programming language has its own necessities in terms of extensions)
- [ ] Always `indent` (sangr√≠a) your code (for instance, with the sequence:  Ctrl+A  Ctrl+K  Ctrl+F)
